# Van Life
**Van Life** is a React application focused on van rentals and the van life community. Built with React Router 6 and Firebase, users can filter vans by specific tags, create accounts, and host their own vans on the platform. It operates similarly to Airbnb, but exclusively for van rentals.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, navigate to the root directory and run: 

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)
